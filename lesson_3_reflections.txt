When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When collaborating with others
- When working with different computers
- To share the work and get input from others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- When working on a feature it may make sense to wait until it is done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks are copies of another users repository on GitHub. You would use it to make changes to a someone's work without changing the other repository.
- clones are copies of local repositories with other local repositories or a repository on GitHub.
- branches are different versions within one local repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- Ability to work without Internet connection
