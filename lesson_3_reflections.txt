When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When collaborating with others
- When working with different computers
- To share the work and get input from others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- When working on a feature it may make sense to wait until it is done.
